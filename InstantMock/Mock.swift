/**
    A `Mock` instance is dedicated to being used in unit tests, in order to mock some specific behaviors.
    It can be used in two particular cases:
    - **verify** some behaviors with **expectations** (represented by the `Expectation` class)
    - **stub** behaviors, to return or perform some actions under certain conditions (stubs are represented by the
    `Stub` class)

    Example of an expectation being verified:

        let mock: Mock
        mock.expect().call(mock.someMethod())
        mock.verify()

    Example of a stub:

        let mock: Mock
        mock.stub().call(mock.someMethod()).andReturn(someValue)
